## Creating FE

3. Added post and get elements. Also added Delete method that works as update too

4. Creating Register/Login form

5. Adding components

6. Creating registrations page

7. Creating Bills page

8. Creating Archived page. 

9. Creating AddBills and AddRegisters page.

## Major change

10. The home page went from being main page to the registration page. It's because I thought that the main page should have it's own component and seperated them. Now the page that a user sees for the first time is the main page, and to get to home is /registrations.

## Working FE

11. Most of the data is being transfered from component to component through props. For example button already gets around 10 props just from other components.

12. The React is also stored to digitalocean from where it is working and env file is getting that URL, but due to the security risk I will not share it here
